## Docker

**Docker** is an open-source platform that helps developers build, ship, and run applications in **containers**. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

### üîß In Simple Terms:

Think of Docker as a **box** that wraps your application and its environment (like OS dependencies) so it can run **consistently** anywhere ‚Äî on your machine, someone else‚Äôs, a server, or the cloud.

---

### üí° Why Use Docker?

1. **Portability**: Write code once, run it anywhere (local, staging, production).
2. **Consistency**: Same behavior regardless of environment.
3. **Efficiency**: Uses less resources than traditional virtual machines.
4. **Isolation**: Each container runs independently from others.
5. **Speed**: Faster to start and deploy than VMs.

### üì¶ Key Concepts:

| Term               | Description                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Image**          | A snapshot of a container. It's a blueprint (like a class in OOP). |
| **Container**      | A running instance of an image (like an object of a class).        |
| **Dockerfile**     | A text file with instructions to build a Docker image.             |
| **Docker Hub**     | A cloud registry to store and share Docker images.                 |
| **Volume**         | A way to persist data outside of containers.                       |
| **Docker Compose** | Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. |

### üîç **Architecture**

| Feature            | **Docker (Containers)**      | **Virtual Machines (VMs)**         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **OS Layer**       | Shares host OS kernel        | Has its own OS (includes guest OS) |
| **Isolation**      | Process-level isolation      | Full machine-level isolation       |
| **Boot Time**      | Seconds                      | Minutes                            |
| **Size**           | Lightweight (MBs)            | Heavy (GBs)                        |
| **Resource Usage** | Minimal (no full OS per app) | High (runs full OS per VM)         |

### üß± **Components**

- **Docker**

  - Runs containers from images
  - Uses host‚Äôs OS kernel
  - Requires Docker Engine

- **VMs**

  - Runs complete OS using hypervisor (like VirtualBox, VMware, KVM)
  - Needs more CPU, RAM, and storage

| Rapid development & testing                  | ‚úÖ Docker             |
| Running microservices                        | ‚úÖ Docker             |
| Running different OS (e.g., Linux + Windows) | ‚úÖ VM                 |
| Full isolation for security                  | ‚úÖ VM (more isolated) |
