    "\n",
    "In 3000 years of our history, people from all over the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. From Alexander onwards, the Greeks, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch—all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet, we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, or their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because we respect the freedom of others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That is why my **first vision is that of freedom.** I believe that India got its first vision of freedom in 1857 when we started the War of Independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build upon. If we are not free, no one will respect us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My **second vision for India is development.** For fifty years, we have been a developing nation. It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among the top five nations of the world in terms of GDP. We have 10 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being recognized globally. Yet, we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My **third vision is that India must stand up to the world.** Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that unless we strengthen ourselves and stand up to the world, we will always be seen as a developing nation or even worse, a struggling nation. It is time for us to see ourselves as a great nation. We are a great nation. We have immense potential, and we must recognize that.  \n",
